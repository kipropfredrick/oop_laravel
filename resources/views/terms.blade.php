            </p>

            <h3>Order Acceptance</h3>

            <p>
            An order is created immediately upon making a booking for any of the products offered on the platform. You are only allowed to place one order at a time. Generally, you have to completely pay for the item you ordered first before you can be allowed to book for another item.
            </p>

            <p>
            You are allowed to transfer your order from one product to another.
            </p>

            <h3>Payment</h3>

            <p>
            The minimum amount allowed for any order is KSh.500. There are no limitations to how many installments you can make until you fully pay for your order.
            </p>

            <p>
            The total cost charged includes the delivery cost to your preferred location.
            </p>

            <p>
            Any amount paid to Mosmos is non-refundable. In case you want to cancel your order, your money remains but you can only transfer to another product (new order) depending on the amount already paid. No cash refunds will be made.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We offer a 90 days payment period, after which, upon completion of payment, we shall deliver to your delivery address through third party delivery partners. By any chance your delivery location has changed, we can make arrangements on the change, however, any additional cost of delivery will be charged.
            </p>

            <p>
            Within the 90 days, your item will be reserved for you, you can extend past 90 days, but your item can be booked by someone else and delivery will depend on availability of the item.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Product Pricing</h3>

            <p>
            We try as much as possible to provide accurate pricing data on all products offered on this website. In case an order youâ€™ve placed has the wrong pricing information, we reserve the right to make amendments of the price, cancel your order but upon adequate communication with you. This can happen whether the order is active or completed.
            </p>

            <h3>Product Returns</h3>

            <p>
            Mosmos wants you to be thrilled with your new purchase. However, if you need to return an item, we're here to help.
            </p>

            <p>
            Upon examination of your return request, we reserve the right to accept your return or not to.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are a few important things to keep in mind when returning a product you purchased online from Mosmos:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                You have 7 calendar days to return an item from the date you received it.
                </li>

                <li>
                Only items that have been purchased directly from Mosmos, either on our website or through USSD, can be returned to Mosmos.
                </li>

                <li>
                Please ensure that the item you're returning is repackaged with all the associated items  and documentation that were included when you received it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Severability</h3>

            <p>
            In the event any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired and the Agreement shall not be void for this reason alone. Such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a mutually acceptable valid, legal and enforceable provision, which comes closest to the intention of the parties underlying the invalid.
            </p>
